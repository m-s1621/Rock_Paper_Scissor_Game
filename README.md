# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game
Introduction

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game webpage! This project aims to provide a visually appealing and interactive implementation of the classic game with a modern twist.

The scoreboard prominently displays the current scores of both players, keeping users informed about the game progress.

A dynamic paragraph dynamically updates to show which choice beats which, providing clarity on the game rules and outcomes.

The game dynamically monitors the scores, and when one player reaches 5 points, a message is displayed indicating the winner. The game then stops to signify the end of the match.
